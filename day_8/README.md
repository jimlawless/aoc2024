In a recent episode of my podcast ( Stray Pointers ) two friends and I discuss the AoC competition from prior years and our intended approaches to this year's competition.  You might want to give it a listen.

We'll be meeting up again soon for a new episode to discuss how we're faring in this year's competition.
